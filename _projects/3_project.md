<b> Role: </b> Technical Head / Mechanical Design Engineer


Mars Rover Manipal is a multi-disciplinary student team from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) striving to design and build next generation rovers for exploration of extraterrestrial environments and focus on applications of robotics in interplanetary missions. Since the inception, the team has provided a platform to aspiring engineering students by pushing them beyond the theoretical knowledge they gain in classrooms to inculcate technical and practical skills. The team is also working on research related to the role of a rover in the field of space exploration and future Mars missions. 

I directed all technical operations of MRM, a team of 40 engineering undergraduates from 5 disciplines, involved in over 10 research & development projects and 7 international competitions. \
Engineered a Mars Rover Prototype for extra-terrestrial exploration comprising an on-board 6-DOF Robotic Manipulator with Inverse Kinematic Control, Custom 40:1 Cycloidal 3D-Printed Gearbox, and a novel 5-bar Suspension System to compete in University Rover Challenge (Ranked 1st in Asia).
