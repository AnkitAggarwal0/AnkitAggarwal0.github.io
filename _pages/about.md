<h4> Hey! My name is Ankit Aggarwal. I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD) at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. As part of this program, my capstone project lies in the domain of Space Robotics – <a href = "projects/1_project">Lunar ROADSTER </a>, a Robotic Operator for Autonomous Development of Surface Trails and Exploration Routes. </h4>

<h4> My core interest lies in creating robots in unpredictable environments. This ranges from robots that operate in extra-terrestrial conditions or aid humans work in hard-to-access mining sites. Robotics allows me to explore a broad spectrum of engineering problems, and I enjoy creating complete multi-disciplinary systems from the ground up.  </h4>

<h4> I recently graduated from Manipal Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Technology degree. My major was Mechatronics, and my minor was Robotics and Automation. During my undergraduate tenure, I led a team of undergraduate students to various international robotics competitions with Mars Rover Manipal and research projects in the domain of parallel robots and IoT. </h4>


<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
