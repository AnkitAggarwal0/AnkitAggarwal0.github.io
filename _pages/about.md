Hey! My name is Ankit Aggarwal. I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD) at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. As part of this program, my capstone project lies in the domain of Space Robotics – <Lunar ROADSTER>, a Robotics Operator for Autonomous Development of Surface Trails and Exploration Routes.  

My core interest lies in creating robots in unpredictable environments. This ranges from robots that operate in extra-terrestrial conditions or aid humans work in hard-to-access mining sites. Robotics allows me to explore a broad spectrum of engineering problems, and I enjoy creating complete multi-disciplinary systems from the ground up.  

I recently graduated from Manipal Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Technology degree. My major was Mechatronics, and my minor was Robotics and Automation. During my undergraduate tenure, I led a team of undergraduate students to various international robotics competitions with <Mars Rover Manipal> and research projects in the domain of <parallel robots> and <IoT>.  

In 2024, I interned at Amazon India as a Program Manager Intern in Supply Chain Operations. My work involved transitioning the forecasting methodology from a heuristic-based manual calculation to Monte-Carlo simulation-based predictions.  

In 2023, I was a MITACS Globalink Intern at the Continuum Robotics Laboratory in University of Toronto. Under Prof. Jessica Burgner-Kahrs, I designed and fabricated a <portable continuum robot> as part of the OpenCR Project.  

In 2022, I interned at STMicroelectronics as an Application Engineer. I developed <Mecanum-wheeled robot> integrated into a BLE mesh for manual and autonomous control. I interfaced various MEMS sensors using the STM32 microcontroller at a register level.
