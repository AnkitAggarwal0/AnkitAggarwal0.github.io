  abstract={Nowadays, in metropolises, both parents are working; therefore, it is of paramount importance to ensure the well-being of the infant. As a result, it is challenging to ensure the infant's safety, security, and comfort. The present study introduces an innovative solution that uses humidity and sound sensors for continuous monitoring of the infant's bed and environmental conditions in the cradle. Along with that, a camera is also installed for continuous monitoring using live streaming through the live mobile application. The notable new addition to this study was the integration of the auto-cleaning system into the smart cradle, which is yet unexplored in the field of smart cradle systems for infant care. The Raspberry Pi control was used as the central control for the monitoring system, and Arduino was deployed for the control of the cradle movement, which used the PWM-based control of the motor for the cradle moment. As infants urinate and start crying, it is detected through a sound sensor, and it starts shaking the cradle while simultaneously checking the moisture conditions in the bed, which updates the parent with a message on their mobile. On the request of the parent, the auto-cleaning system can be used for the change of the sheet, which also ensures the safety of the infant by taking feedback using an ultrasonic sensor that the baby is not in the cradle and then changing the sheet using the motorized control. This illustrates the potential of the IoT in infant care and safety. By actively monitoring sound and humidity levels, caregivers gain valuable insights into the infant's needs, allowing them to make real-time adjustments to the cradle's motions. Incorporating a camera and a mobile app further enhances monitoring and accessibility.},

  abstract="The parallel mechanisms are mostly used in industrial and robotics applications for achieving desired tasks. The performance of the mechanism depends upon the many parameters like link joint clearance and manufacturing defects. A new mathematical model is developed for the analysis of linear input (prismatic joint) mechanisms under the effects of joint clearance. This paper presents the loop closure equation used for estimating the mechanical/position error due to the effect of link tolerances. The results evaluate the position error using a mathematical approach. The results are validated by the CAD model approach. The demonstrated case is illustrated in this paper.",
